Bontact helps you connect with your website visitors and turn them into converting customers, through a multi-channel, flexible, real-time, and easy-to-use customer engagement platform. The platform is the only solution of its kind to combine text messages, callback, e-mail, and live chat options.

Presenting potential customers, while they are at the peak of interest, with flexible options to connect with your sales team has tremendous business potential. It enhances user experience and satisfaction, increases the “stickiness” of your website (average visit duration), and – most importantly — can significantly increase the number of leads and sales. Combined with the right sales and support staff, Bontact can even turn random online visitors into committed customers.FREE version available now, or full Botact packages for special prices.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Callback? =
Bontact allows users to call your sales or customer support representatives by clicking a button, without picking up a phone.

= Can I see a list of all the calls that been made? =
Yes. Once you sign up, you receive a user name and password for the dashboard. There you may view the time of the call and call duration.

= Why should I use Bontact’s Callback service and not just publish a phone number? =
You can do both. But Callback cannot be compared to a regular phone number. The Callback feature on your website is a value-add service that helps you generate more inquiries. It gives you an edge over your competitors and adds a “human touch” to your Website. As opposed to regular phone calls, Callback is also completely effortless and free for customers.

Every Callback results in two calls – one to the web visitor and another one to you. We use normal PSTN Lines (NOT VoIP) to maintain a high quality of voice call and fast connection.

Toll free is actually a more costly solution. It also requires you to set up proper hardware and is not ideal for smaller companies.
